# South Carolina Police Shooting Data
Project for Code Louisville Python/SQL Course Spring 2019.

This project examines the data collected from multiple South Carolina law enforcement agencies (primarily police departments and sheriff departments) where officers fired their weapons. The shooting incidents occurred between 2009 and 2018.

The data was provided to me by the Greenville News and was collected from a variety of law enforcement agencies through the use of public records and Freedom of Information Act requests.

## Aim of the project
This projects hopes to achieve the following:
1. What areas of South Carolina have higher rates of police shootings?
2. Are there certain law enforcement agencies that have higher rates of police shootings?
3. Have incidents of police shootings risen since 2009?
4. Is there a correlation between police shootings and the ethnicity of the suspects?
5. Is there a correlation between police shootings and the type of incident the officer is responding to?
